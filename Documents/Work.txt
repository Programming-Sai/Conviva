In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized various fields, including computer vision and medical imaging. This paper explores the application of deep learning techniques to improve image reconstruction in medical diagnostics, focusing specifically on photoacoustic tomography (PAT). PAT is a biomedical imaging technique that combines light and sound to visualize structures inside biological tissues. The study investigates two deep learning architectures, U-Net and S-Net, for reconstructing high-resolution images from sparse and limited-view acoustic data. The effectiveness of these architectures is evaluated through numerical experiments, demonstrating their capability to reduce artifacts and enhance image quality.Image reconstruction is a critical task in medical imaging, where obtaining clear and accurate images of internal structures is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional methods often face challenges with sparse data and limited sensor coverage in imaging techniques like PAT. Deep learning offers promising solutions by leveraging neural networks to learn complex patterns from data and improve reconstruction accuracy.Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses short pulses of laser light to generate acoustic waves inside tissues. These waves are detected by sensors placed outside the tissue, allowing reconstruction of images showing the distribution of light-absorbing structures. The initial pressure distribution inside the tissue, crucial for understanding biological features, is reconstructed from acoustic measurements.
